# Corona Virus Application

The goal of this application is to use the data from [CoronaVirus API](http://coronavirusapi.com)[Do check them out, they are doing a really good job of providing the real numbers on people who have been infected with the corona virus] and then provide the information on a state by state basis in a graphical form to the user. Hopefully, we will be also be able to predict the peak date for each state based on the current data and in addition provide how the curve will look like if stringent measures are taken to contain the spread of the virus.
